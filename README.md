# SnapCorgi

## What Is it?
This is a very simple, quick, hacked together project to send daily corgi SnapChat photos to those who want them. It still needs some work, including:

* Cleaning up the code
* Adding unsubscribe

It's made available online as part of my effort to make all of the code I write open source.

## How Does It Work?
It grabs the top photo of the day from /r/corgi on reddit and snapchats it to friends of the defined SnapChat account. To use it, just copy `secrets.example.php` to `secrets.php`, edit, and run send_corgi_photo.php.
